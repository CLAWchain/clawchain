# ClawChain Token Standards

This directory contains the documentation for the token standards supported by the ClawChain platform. The two main standards covered are:

- [CRC-20: Fungible Tokens](crc-20.md)
- [CRC-721: Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)](crc-721.md)

These standards define the technical specifications, usage guidelines, and any ClawChain-specific considerations for developers building token-based applications on the ClawChain network.
