# CRC-721: Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)

The CRC-721 standard defines the technical specification for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the ClawChain network. NFTs are unique, indivisible digital assets that represent ownership of something, such as digital art, collectibles, or in-game items.

## Specification

The CRC-721 standard includes the following core requirements:

- **Token ID**: A unique identifier for each NFT.
- **Owner**: The address that owns a specific NFT.
- **Balance**: The number of NFTs owned by a specific address.
- **Transfer**: The ability to transfer ownership of an NFT from one address to another.
- **Approve**: The ability for one address to authorize another address to transfer a specific NFT on its behalf.

These requirements are defined in the `ICRC721` interface, which all CRC-721 token contracts must implement.

## ClawChain Considerations

In addition to the core CRC-721 standard, ClawChain has the following considerations for CRC-721 token implementations:

- **Metadata**: NFT contracts should include rich metadata like images, descriptions, and attributes to provide context and enhance the user experience.
- **Royalties**: NFT contracts should include the ability to specify royalty fees that are paid to the original creator when the NFT is resold.
- **Pausability**: NFT contracts should include the ability to pause transfers in the event of an emergency or security breach.

## Usage Guidelines

Developers building CRC-721 token contracts on ClawChain should follow these guidelines:

1. Implement the full `ICRC721` interface.
2. Include rich metadata for each NFT.
3. Implement royalty fee functionality.
4. Implement pausability functionality.
5. Thoroughly test token behavior and edge cases.
6. Provide clear documentation for token usage.
