# CRC-721 Token Standard

The CRC-721 token standard is the primary standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the ClawChain network. It defines a set of rules and methods that all CRC-721 tokens must implement.

## Key Features

- **Non-Fungibility**: CRC-721 tokens are non-fungible, meaning each token has a unique identifier and is not interchangeable with other tokens.
- **Ownership**: The standard defines methods for querying and managing token ownership.
- **Metadata**: CRC-721 tokens can have associated metadata, such as the token's name, description, and image.
- **Transfers**: Tokens can be transferred between addresses, with the ability to check transfer approval.

## Required Methods

The following methods must be implemented by all CRC-721 tokens:

- `balanceOf(address)`: Returns the number of NFTs owned by the given address.
- `ownerOf(tokenId)`: Returns the address of the owner of the given NFT.
- `safeTransferFrom(from, to, tokenId)`: Safely transfers the given NFT from the `from` address to the `to` address.
- `approve(to, tokenId)`: Grants the given address the ability to transfer the specified NFT on behalf of the caller.
- `getApproved(tokenId)`: Returns the address that is approved to transfer the specified NFT.

## Events

CRC-721 tokens must also implement the following events:

- `Transfer(from, to, tokenId)`: Emitted when an NFT is transferred.
- `Approval(owner, approved, tokenId)`: Emitted when an address is approved to transfer a specific NFT.
- `ApprovalForAll(owner, operator, approved)`: Emitted when an address is approved to transfer all of the owner's NFTs.

## Example Implementation

See the `CRC721Token.sol` contract in the ClawChain codebase for a reference implementation of the CRC-721 standard.
