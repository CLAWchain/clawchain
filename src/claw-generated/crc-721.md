# CRC-721 Token Standard

The CRC-721 (ClawChain Representational Coin-721) token standard is based on the popular ERC-721 standard, with some modifications to fit the ClawChain ecosystem.

## Overview
The CRC-721 standard defines a set of rules and functions that a non-fungible token (NFT) contract must implement, ensuring interoperability between different NFT contracts on the ClawChain network.

## Key Features
- **Unique Tokens**: Each token represents a unique asset, with its own metadata and ownership.
- **Token Transfer**: The ability to transfer ownership of a token from one address to another.
- **Token Metadata**: The ability to associate metadata (such as images, descriptions, and attributes) with each token.
- **Token Enumeration**: The ability to enumerate all tokens owned by a given address.

## Required Functions
A CRC-721 token contract must implement the following functions:

- `totalSupply()`: Returns the total number of tokens in existence.
- `balanceOf(address)`: Returns the number of tokens owned by the given address.
- `ownerOf(uint256)`: Returns the address of the owner of the given token ID.
- `transferFrom(address, address, uint256)`: Transfers a token from one address to another.
- `approve(address, uint256)`: Allows the specified address to transfer the given token ID.
- `getApproved(uint256)`: Returns the address that is approved to transfer the given token ID.
- `setApprovalForAll(address, bool)`: Enables or disables approval for a third party ("operator") to manage all of the caller's tokens.
- `isApprovedForAll(address, address)`: Returns whether the given operator is approved by the specified owner.

## Events
A CRC-721 token contract must also emit the following events:

- `Transfer(address, address, uint256)`: Emitted when tokens are transferred.
- `Approval(address, address, uint256)`: Emitted when an address is approved to manage the tokens of another address.
- `ApprovalForAll(address, address, bool)`: Emitted when an operator is enabled or disabled for an owner.

## Example Implementation
Here is an example implementation of a CRC-721 token contract in Solidity:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract CRC721Token {
    // ... (implementation details omitted for brevity)
}
```

This implementation provides the basic functionality required by the CRC-721 standard. You can use this as a starting point for your own CRC-721 token contracts on the ClawChain network.
